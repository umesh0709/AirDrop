        <h2>What is Binance Coin?</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency issued by Binance exchange and trades with the BNB symbol. As of Q2 2022, Binance Exchange is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, with a volume of $7.6 billion.Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency issued by the Binance exchange and trades with the BNB symbol. BNB was initially based on the Ethereum network but is now the native currency of Binance's own blockchain, the Binance chain.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binance coin initially ran on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC 20 standard but has since become the native coin of the Binance chain. It was launched during an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017 and has a strict maximum of 200 million BNB tokens. It offered 10%, or 20 million, BNB tokens to angel investors, 40%, or 80 million, tokens to the founding team, and the remaining 50%, or 100 million, to the various participants through the ICO process.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BNB is a crypto asset similar to other digital assets on the market in that it rises and falls in value as people use and trade it. People can hold BNB in compatible wallets off crypto exchanges and send the coin directly to others for payments or otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When constructing the BNB chain, Binance tailored the blockchain for optimal performance when it came to trading on-chain, basing Binance DEX, Binance’s decentralized exchange (DEX), on this newly formed chain. Moreover, BNB chain transactions are fueled by a blockchain gas token called BNB, which stands for "Build and Build" (previously known as Binance Coin).

        <h2>What is Binance coin burning?</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binance spends some of its revenues each quarter to purchase back and burn Binance Coins, totally eliminating them. Binance has continuously performed quarterly burns since 2017.Binance will continue burning BNB coins every quarter until it has purchased and destroyed 100 million Binance coins, or half of its original maximum supply. The process decreases Binance Coin's supply and affects its rarity, which can potentially affect the asset’s value.
        </p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binance will continue burning BNB coins every quarter until it has purchased and destroyed 100 million Binance coins, or half of its original maximum supply. The process decreases Binance Coin's supply and affects its rarity, which can potentially affect the asset’s value. Binance also has something called the BNB Pioneer Burn Program, which evaluates certain instances in which BNB holders unrecoverably lost BNB, and repays them, deducting the amount from the next BNB burn.
